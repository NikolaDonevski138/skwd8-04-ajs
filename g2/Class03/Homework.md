When the button is clicked, call the StarWars API to get all the films.

* Task 2:
Print also the amount of characters, planets, starships, vehicles and species, each of them in a separate column

* Bonus:
Print the name of the first character of each film \
(hint: you are not restricted to only one ajax call)

**NOTE:** JQuery will automatically parse this call (js will not).
